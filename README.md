# AI_Agent_oyesense

This project implements a semi-autonomous web interaction agent that explores a real website, observes its state, makes runtime decisions, performs actions, and produces meaningful insights about website behavior and usability.

Instead of relying on fully scripted automation, the agent is designed to reason about what it sees, adapt its actions dynamically, and stop intentionally when no further meaningful exploration is possible.

The goal of this project is not exhaustive testing, but to demonstrate decision-making, reasoning, and system design in an ambiguous web environment.
